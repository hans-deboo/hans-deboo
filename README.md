- 👋 Hi, I’m @hans-deboo
- 🌱 After discovering the ATmega328 in the Arduino several years ago, I was amazed and cannot understand why I was afraid of it before.
- 📫 Thanks to a wonderful team of <a href=https://codeclub.org/en/coderdojo-community>Coderdojo</a> volunteers, I had the honour to be a part of, we had the opportunity to build our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=389083273455362">CyberCircleChallenge</a> full self-built hardware and software, where I learned a massive amount, which has sparked my imagination and created a nearly endless list of future projects.
- 💞️ Now I'm fond of the versatile (and cheap) ESP32 to power all of my little projects
- 👀 My key driver is building real world overengineerd solutions combining electronics, code, 3d design and printing, woodworking, ... for problems I never knew existsed before 😄 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
